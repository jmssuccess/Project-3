<H1> Interactive Visualization</H1>

The purpose of today's project is to use data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the New Jersey market that are viable investment opportunities.

<H1> MODULES USED</H1>
<li>import pandas as pd</li>
<li>import hvplot.pandas</li>
<li>from pathlib import Path</li>
<li>from sklearn.cluster import KMeans</li>
<li>sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler</li>
<H2><em><strong>STEPS TO OPERATING DATAFRAME</strong></em></H2>



<H1> Flow </H1>
<li>User imports Modules for analysis.</li>
 <li>User Uploads CSV Data for analysis </li>
 <li> Scale Data using StandardScaler to Normalize Dataframe Values </li>
 <li>Calculate and plot the housing units per year.</li>
 <li>Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.</li>
 <li>Compare the average prices by neighborhood.</li>
 <li>Build an interactive neighborhood map.</li>

<H2>Compose your data story. </H2>
 <li>  </li>
 <li> </li>

<H2>Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year </H2>
     <li>use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year,/li>
    <li> Use the groupby function to group the data by year. Aggregate the results by the mean of the groups.
   

 <H2>Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot</H2>

Use the hvplot function to plot the housing_units_by_year DataFrame as a bar chart. 
Make the x-axis represent the year and the y-axis represent the housing_units.
<H2>PULL PLOT </H2>
     <li>utilizing hvplot </li>
     <li>Note:You may use a specific plot which utilizes tickers </li>
   
<H2>Utilize hvplot</H2>
<li>hvplot is utilized as a means to show data in a more interactive way. It allows us to physically interact with the data in order for the user analyze the data more efficiently.</li>
